+++ What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Additional .git folder is created with some Git repo metadata.

+++ How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
It looks like buffer for a developer

+++ How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
TBH, dunnow :) But can assume that git diff --staged is very helpful in it

+++ What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
When new feature is added, but it's untested and may affect badly to the initial code

+++ How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
I can track the exact commit from which the another branch derived, and it helps me to find out how many new updates are missed
in this another branch

+++ What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
All commits from both branches will be in resulting git log
