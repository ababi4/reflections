+++ How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

It helps with easy comparing of content of both files. We know that previous version of the file worked
well and we need to find out which stuff in new verion broke it. The 'diff' command shows  all changes 
in details.

BTW, we can use cool colored diff in Linux, just need to install it:

sudo apt-get install colordiff

+++ How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

It would be very useful for localization of the point of failure

+++ What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

I love and prefer automatic one.

+++ Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Because multiple files often depend strongly on each other, and even a small change in on of them can affect the others.

+++ How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

I can track commits' IDs, compare changes made in each of them and locate the exact change which affect something (badly, for instance) in the project

+++ How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

Because of possible rollback after any change made.

+++ Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

For fun :)
